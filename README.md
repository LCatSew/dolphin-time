## Description
    
- I was motivated to create an employee database so companies can easily keep track of their employees, managers, roles, salaries, and departments as well as make adjustments to that data.
- I learned a lot about SQL, specifically using connection queries to more adavanced selections, updates, inserts, joins, and more.
- Some challenges I faced were getting my connection queries properly up and running. It was not as simple as SELECT * EMPLOYEES for most of it and I had to do a lot of research and trouble shooting to make it work properly.

## Installation

To install the project you will want to start by running npm i. after you'll login to your mysql account. Make sure to go into the server js file and update the user and password to match you're login information. Then you'll run source db/schema.sql . after that you can choose to seed the database by running SOURCE db/seeds.sql or leave it unseeded and insert your own data later. then you can run exit to leave mysql. enter npm start in the terminal and you will be presented with the prompts. 


## Contributing

I referenced [this](https://github.com/ajcuddeback/EmployeeTracker) repository for my initial creation to get an idea of how to structure my folders, but ended up making a lot of changes after that.
